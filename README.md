## 🚦 Plan Management & Licensing

Tailor POS supports a flexible, config-driven licensing system with four plans:

- **Trial:** All features for 15 days (free)
- **Basic:** All features for 1 month, then only basic features (billing, product/customer management)
- **PRO:** Lifetime access to all features
- **Enterprise:** Custom solutions with additional features

Plan status, expiry, and feature access are managed via `config.json` and enforced in both backend and frontend. Upgrades and plan changes are supported via API and UI.

### Plan Enforcement
- **Trial Expiry:** All features locked after 15 days
- **Basic Expiry:** PRO features (dashboard, customer search, backup/restore) locked after 1 month
- **PRO:** Never expires, all features always available
- **Enterprise:** Custom features and support
